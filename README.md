# üìú Philosophy Behind WebARB

What is the most common thing on every machine that a non-technical person use frequently with ease?

- A Web Browser, eg: Firefox, Brave...

Hence why WebARB is an open-source web based internationalization tool to aid translators with ease to translate `.arb` files without running, installing or configuring anything.

The tool **MUST**:

- Not need an account
- Be easy to use
- Looks simple
- Customizable
- Accessible
- Reliable
- Free

# ü§î Who Is This For?

This is a free open-source solution for small to medium projects who do not want to invest in anything big right now (or ever) but still want to be able to internationalize their Flutter applications with ease and no technical jargon.

## Scenario

    1. You created an app (eg: Flutter app)
    2. The app is in a single language (eg: English)
    3. Your friend doesn't know how to code, navigate code-looking data, nor how to go about translating these files without messing up everything (eg: My grand father)
    4. They offer to help you with the translation, but you gotta be with them the whole time
    5. You don't have the time to babysit them
    6. SOOO, you send them this repo (link/zip/whatever floats your boat)
    7. They see basic easy interface that they can use
    8. They successfully translate your app
    9. Profit

**Outcomes:**

- You saved yourself time (time is money)
- Worked on better things yourself
- Barely did any babysitting
- Your app got translated (Hooray!)

# üíª How To Use/Install?
